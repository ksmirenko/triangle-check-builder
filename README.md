# triangle-check-builder
A builder for the TriangleCheck utility. Has been implemented as part of a university task.

## Requirements:
- build-tools/mainsend.exe - for sending reports
- build-tools/NuGet.exe
- MSBuild (.NET Framework 4.0 or higher) - for building. Make sure the path is set correctly in *settings.bat*.
- packages/NUnit.Runners.2.6.4/tools/nunit-console.exe - the builder downloads it automatically.

**Please note** that all the tools mentioned above may be located anywhere on your computer, as long as all paths are correctly set in *settings.bat*.
